C# has 3 types of Integer:
Int16(+- 2^15), Int32(+- 2^31), Int64(+- 2^63)
int - Int32 are indeed synonymous but a little different use as int: more familiar, Int32: 32-bit more explicit

Switch Expression: Other way writing Switch() C#:
string = number switch
{
1 => "case 1",
2 => "case 2",
_ => "default"
}

Good Practice: Add XML documentation comments to all your functions.

Popular approach in TDD is to write a (failing) test before implementing target code.

A class library is package of code can be distributed - referenced by other .NET app

Composition - Aggregation in OOP -> Seat and Car - Driver and Car

top level class,  delegate, interface : internal
method: private
members (unless an interface or enum): private
members (of interface or enum): public
constructor: private (if no constructor defined, public default constructor will be automatically defined)
explicitly implemented interface member: public!

only 1 file-scoped namespace per file

 String interpolation is performed at compile-time

Static constructor used to initialize static data, or perform a particular action that needs to be performed only once
